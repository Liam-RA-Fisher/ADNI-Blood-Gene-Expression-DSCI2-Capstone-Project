# ADNI Blood Gene Expression DSCI2 Capstone Project

## Background

- 1 in 9 Americans older than 65 have Alzheimer’s dementia
- Treatment in the United States cost $305 billion in 2020
- 12.5 million projected to have Alzheimer’s dementia by 2050
- Disease still not fully understood
- Alzheimer’s has certain gene expressions: https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/gene-expression-signatures-alzheimers-disease

## Data

<img src="https://github.com/Liam-RA-Fisher/ADNI-Blood-Gene-Expression-DSCI2-Capstone-Project/blob/main/ADNI_logo_vector.png" width=30% height=30%>

I am using the micro array gene expression and diagnosis data from the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative.
http://adni.loni.usc.edu/
The data contains Alzheimer’s diagnoses based on MRI scans, PET scans, and professional evaluations.

The data tables that I am using are:

1. ADMIMERGE: Contains basic patient information and their diagnoses.
2. ADNI_Gene_Expression_Profile: Contains gene expression data from blood samples.

To aapply for the data tables you can visit the Image and Data Archive from the University of Sothern California.

## Objective

To Use the blood gene expression data to build a predictive model for the detection of Alzheimer’s data.
If blood gene expression data can predict Alzheimer's it may be a more acessible doagnosis compared to MRI and PET scans.
I also intend to do some exploratory analysis to see which gene expressions have evidence that they are associated with Alzheimer’s.

#### Capstone Presentation Technical.pptx
A final presentation of the project and the results

#### Capstone_Project_Pt1.Rmd
The initial data wrangling in R. Here the data is loaded and wrangled. The data is also visualized and train test splits are created for modelling.

#### Capstone_Project_Pt2.ipynb
The modelling portion of the project in Python. Her various dimensionality reduction and machine learining teqniques are applied to the genetic data in the attempt to predict Alzheimers.

#### Capstone_Project_pt3.Rmd
A further analysis of the genetic data. Here the Analysis of Variance is used to detect which genes are the most correlated with Alzheimer's diagnosis.

#### Capstone_Project_Pt3_continued.ipynb
A continuation of the deeper analysis. Here Random Forest feature importances are used to detect which Genes are the most usefull in preicting Alzheimers.

**Note:** Each Notebook / Markdown is rendered into an html file.

## Results

### Prepped Data

Number of Genetic Expressions:    49390
Patient Classifications:          CN, MCI, AD

### Best Model
The best model was the Extra Trees Classifier. Still it was not able to predict Alzheimers very well. There are many possible reasons for this which include: too little data, too little data in some target classes, too much disparity in target classes, genetic data not sufficient for diagnosis. The following image shows how well the ExtraTrees classifier performed on the test dataset.

### Deeper Analysis Results.

The following are box plots of gene distributions by diagnosis. The first plot is the result best gene as a result of the ANOVA repeated, and the second plot is the result of the gene with the highest Random Forest feature importance.
