# ADNI Blood Gene Expression DSCI2 Capstone Project

## Background

- 1 in 9 Americans older than 65 have Alzheimer’s dementia
- Treatment in the United States cost $305 billion in 2020
- 12.5 million projected to have Alzheimer’s dementia by 2050
- Disease is still not fully understood
- Alzheimer’s has certain gene expressions: https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/gene-expression-signatures-alzheimers-disease

## Data

<img src="https://github.com/Liam-RA-Fisher/ADNI-Blood-Gene-Expression-DSCI2-Capstone-Project/blob/main/ADNI_logo_vector.png" width=30% height=30%>

I am using the micro array gene expression and diagnosis data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
http://adni.loni.usc.edu/
The data contains Alzheimer’s diagnoses based on MRI scans, PET scans, professional evaluations, and more.

The data tables that I am using are:

1. ADMIMERGE: Contains basic patient information and their diagnoses.
2. ADNI_Gene_Expression_Profile: Contains gene expression data from blood samples.

To apply for the data tables you can visit the Image and Data Archive from the University of Sothern California.

## Objective

The objective of the analysis is to use the blood gene expression data to build a predictive model for the detection of Alzheimer’s data.
If blood gene expression data can predict Alzheimer's it may be a more financialy acessible diagnosis compared to MRI and PET scans.
I also intend to do some exploratory analysis to see which gene expressions have evidence that they are associated with Alzheimer’s.

## Methodology

1. The data requires an application through ADNI. Once approved, the data can be downloaded from LONI (Image and Data Archive). Next the data was dead and wrangled. The data wrangling was done in R. The data was then visualized for normality, integrity, and structure. A stratified shuffle split was also used to create training and testing data.
2. The next step was the data modelling. Due to the large number of genes in the blood gene expression data, dimensionality reduction was used. PCA, an Aucoencoder, and Locally Linear Embedding was used to reduce the data prior to training.
3. Many predictive models were also tried. A Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and an Ensemble Voting Classifier were all used to create predictive models. The Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees Classifier and Support Vector Machine were trained on each of the reduced datasets and each had their hyperperameters trained. The Ensemble Voting Classifier was a combination of the best Random Forest, Extra Trees Classifier and Support Vector Machine.
4. The models were then used to evaluate the testing data and select which one is the best. The f1 score was used as the preffered benchmark. This is because A model which predicts well across all classes is preffered.
5. Next a deeper analysis was done. The Analysis of variance was used to detect gene expression variables that could be connected to diagnosis. Some of the results were visualized.
6. Finally a similar analysis was conducted with Random Forest feature importances. RF feature importances were used to detect which gene expression variables could be connected to diagnosis. Some of the results were visualized.

## Results

### Prepped Data
Number of Participants in Data:   774

Number of Genetic Expressions:    49390

Patient Classifications:          CN, MCI, AD

#### Distribution of Diagnoses
<img src="https://github.com/Liam-RA-Fisher/ADNI-Blood-Gene-Expression-DSCI2-Capstone-Project/blob/main/diagnoses.png" width=60% height=60%>

The people are not evenly distributed in the diagnosis classes. That is why a stratified shuffle split was used for the train/test splitting.

### Best Model
The best model was the Extra Trees Classifier. Still, it was not able to predict Alzheimers very well. There are many possible reasons for this which include: too little data, too little data in some target classes, too much disparity in target classes, genetic data not sufficient for diagnosis. The following image shows how accurate the ExtraTrees classifier performed on the test dataset.

### Deeper Analysis Results

The following are box plots of gene distributions by diagnosis. The first plot is a boxplot of the best gene by diagnosis as a result of the ANOVA repeated, and the second plot is a boxplot of the best gene by diagnosis with the highest Random Forest feature importance.

The gene scores for the different diagnoses are not strikingly different. Certianly not enough to detect Alzheimer's. Even though these two genes were identified as ones with the most potential for connection to Alzheimer's, the plots do not show anything significant.
